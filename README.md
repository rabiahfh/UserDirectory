 ## Description 
  
For this project I created an employee directory with React. TWhere I was required to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

The purpose of this project was to allow the employee or manager to benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It is particularly helpful for them to be able to filter employees by name.
